## :pencil2: How to use

**Using IB/Storyboards:**

Only **3** steps needed to use `SketchView`

**Using code:**

  **1.** Import `Sketch` in proper place.
```swift
import Sketch
```

**2.** Create `SketchView`, and addSubview to the view you want to set.

```Swift
let sketchView = SketchView(frame:
    CGRect(x: 0,
           y: 0,
           width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width,
           height: UIScreen.main.bounds.height
    )
)

self.view.addSubview(sketchView)
```
